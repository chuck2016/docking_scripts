This script was developed to set up the receptor.txt input file needed by VinaMPI [1].

This script finds the size_x size_y size_z center_x center_y and center_z parameters needed by Autodock Vina [2] in order to specify the docking box.

The docking sites used with this script were obtained using MOE [3].

Directions to get docking sites from MOE:

1) Open receptor file in MOE
2) Compute -> Site Finder ...
3) Click on Apply in the Site Finder box to populate the box with potential binding sites
4) Click on the site you want to use
5) Check the Select Residues in SE box
6) From the main MOE menu select File -> Save
7) Check the Only Selected box and choose Residues from the dropdown menu
8) Choose Protein Data Bank (.pdb) from the Format dropdown menu
9) Name the file $receptorbasename_site$n.pdb and save (if the receptor file is named receptor.pdb then $receptorbasename = receptor and n is the docking site number for the particular receptor e.g. if you choose 2 different docking sites for receptor.pdb you will have receptor_site1.pdb and receptor_site2.pdb)
10) Repeat (4)-(9) for each site you want to use in the loaded receptor file
11) File -> Close OK
12) Repeat (1)-(11) for each receptor file for your screen

Directions to create the receptors.txt file:

1) Put all .pdb files of the docking sites obtained above in one directory
2) Change line 11 in get_sites.py to point to your VMD executable
3) Make sure line 31 of get_sites.py points to get_cell_dim.tcl
4) In a terminal type: python get_sites.py $directory
where $directory is the path to a directory containing .pdb files containing docking sites named $receptorbasename_site$n.pdb
5) You should now have a file named receptors.txt to be used with VinaMPI, edit the first line by appending cpu=$x where $x is the number of threads to be used by each docking task (1 if not using threading)

Directions to create a pdbqt file to correspond with each docking site

1) Follow directions to do receptor predocking so that you have a pdbqt for each receptor with the same $receptor names above
2) python dup_receptors.py $receptors $sites $new
$receptors = path to directory containing receptor pdbqt files
$sites = path to directory containing pdb files for all the docking sites
$new = path to directory where receptor pdbqt files will be saved named after each site
3) The $new directory should now contain a pdbqt receptor file named after each docking site
